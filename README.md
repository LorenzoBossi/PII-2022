# Hardware acceleration of a convolutional neural network with *Vitis HLS*


## Project
This repository contains  first experience approaching to *High Level Synthesis* during this [project](https://pii.dei.polimi.it/accelerazione-hardware-di-una-rete-neurale-convoluzionale-mediante-sintesi-ad-alto-livello/), the project required us to create and synthesize a Convolutional Neural Network capable of recognising hand written digits using HLS.
During the last semester we:
* Learnt the structure and implemented a *Convolutional Neural Network* (CNN) in python;
* Trained said network;
* Implemented the CNN in c/c++ using the training data obtained from the python training;
* Revisited the code to make it more "HLS friendly";
* Developed the neural network with *Vitis HLS*;
* Applied different *Vitis* pragmas;
* Implement our final solution
